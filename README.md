## My process

Here are the tools and technologies I employed to address this challenge, insights gained throughout the problem-solving journey, areas in which I aspire to enhance my skills in the coming days, and articles that proved beneficial for me, potentially aiding others in overcoming similar challenges on Frontend Mentor or elsewhere.

This is the approach I took to address this challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Getting more and more proficient in Flexbox and the Responsive design approach. I was able to finish this challenge in less than 90 minutes...It's getting easy? I'm glad it is, now I can move to more sophisticated challenges!

### Continued development

With this challenge done, I finally feel like I have a firm grip on Responsive design. I struggled for months but now I realize the only way to truly learn and understand is through practice. I will only get better from here on out. Its truly euphoric to see my growth. LIVE!

### Useful resources

- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) - This site really helped me out more than anything else I found online. It explained Gradients so well that I finally solved the problem that was holding me back from finishing this challenge for weeks (mostly because I kept putting it off). It's a fantastic place to learn not just CSS but everything about web development. Definitely give it a visit!
